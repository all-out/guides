  Regularly used ships and how they should be fit for small - medium size, low skillpoint wormhole fleets
---

## Introduction

Ships contained here are designed around 5 - 20 million skill points for lowclass wormhole activities.

All fits here work around the assumption of IV level skills. If you plan to use the ships here for PvP
it is strongly recommended you take the extra few days of training to fly them properly.

Everybody in All-Out should be able to fly at least one useful armor ship (Augoror or Prophecy) and
one useful shield ship (Drake or Osprey). If you are unsure what to train, start working on being 
able to fly all ships listed here competently as they are all called on at some point.

If everybody can fly this list it provides a strong baseline we can assume when putting fleets
together, rather than 10 minutes of spaghetti on comms while we sort out fleet composition.

Your particular skills may require downgrading parts of the fit to 'meta' (T1 named modules),
or possibly you have more skill points than expected so may be able to upgrade to T2. 
Always upgrade to T2 if you can and fitting space allows, check with corp before going higher than T2
(green/blue modules).
Downgrading most highslot modules is acceptable, however if there are T2 midslot or lowslot tank modules these are
expected to be there and should be trained almost from day 1 on a new account.

Make sure you pick up items listed as refits in text, these are used to modify your ship depending on what is called for.
If you are poor it is recommended to store these spare modules in home as they can add significantly to the cost of a loss
if they are in cargo.

### Proph

### Aug

### Rolling Battleships

### Drake

### Osprey

### Gnosis

### Blackbird

It is strongly recommended that you have IV cruiser, ECM, capacitor and targeting skills before flying this.

All up expect about a two week train to fly a Blackbird well from a very new account. Accounts with solid
core skills would be able to fly this with only a few days extra training.

If you do not have enough fitting space to use the light missile launchers, leave them offline. They are primarily
used to shoot drones or frigates that may have flown out to tackle you. If you are tackled by a larger ship
you are likely already dead; try to escape by overheating all ECM modules on any ships disrupting your warp
while spamming warp to somewhere safe.

Ideally never be closer than 50km to hostiles in this ship, if you are jumping in to a fight on a wormhole you
should warp off then warp back on at 70km time permitting. If there is a bubble up, heat your MWD and burn out as fast as possible.

Make sure you do not run the MWD when not required, it will drain your capacitor extremely fast.

Read up on ECM guides and match the color of your ECM module to the race.

### Geddon

### Dominix

### Rattlesnake

### Bhaalgorn

Standard fleet fight neut fit below, if somebody asks specifically for a bhaalgorn this is what they are expecting to see.

Assuming you have solid core skills if you are planning to fly a faction battleship, expect this to only take a week to train in to. Amarr BS IV is recommended, V is strong but certainly not a requirement to fly. Minmater BS III is fine as we rarely rely on Bhaalgorns to web despite the fact is is bonused.

When first starting a fight you should run all seven neuts on the same target intially to alpha their capacitor, one cycle will totally remove their capacitor for anything smaller than a battleship. Battleships should be given three cycles. After the first pass, leave a single heavy neut on targets which probably fit injectors (armor), or a single nosferatu on targets which wouldn't (shield). Move the rest of your neuts on to the next target and repeat until you are keeping ~5 targets capped out.

You should loosely focus neuts on the primary target called, however support ships (ECM/Logistics) hould always be higher priority for you in the unlikely event they are in range.

If you are primaried, don't forget to overheat all your lowslot hardeners, this gives a gigantic boost to your tank and they should be able to run heated for up to 5 minutes with proper management.

When you are more confident, swap a midslot module to a ship scanner, this allows you to see hostiles capacitor levels as well as call out any unusual fits you see (bait tanks, guns on ships which shouldn't such as laser nestors).
