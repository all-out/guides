  Regularly used ships and how they should be fit for small - medium size, low skillpoint wormhole fleets
---

## Introduction

Ships contained here are designed around 5 - 20 million skill points for lowclass wormhole activites.

All fits here work around the assumption of IV level skills. If you plan to use the ships here for PvP
it is strongly recommended you take the extra few days of training to fly them properly.

Everybody in All-Out should be able to fly at least one useful armor ship (Augoror or Prophecy) and
one useful shield ship (Drake or Osprey). If you are unsure what to train, start working on being 
able to fly all ships listed here competantly as they are all called on at some point.

If everybody can fly this list it provides a strong baseline we can assume when putting fleets
together, rather than 10 minutes of spaghetti on commms while we sort out fleet composition.

Your particular skills may require downgrading parts of the fit to 'meta' (T1 named modules),
or possibly you have more skill points than expected so may be able to upgrade to T2. 
Always upgrade to T2 if you can and fitting space allows, check with corp before going higher than T2
(green/blue modules).
Downgrading most highslot modules is acceptable, however if there are T2 midslot or lowslot tank modules these are
expected to be there and should be trained almost from day 1 on a new account.

Make sure you pick up items listed in cargo, these are used to refit your ship depending on what is called for.
If you are poor it is recommended to store these spare modules in home as they can add significantly to the cost of a loss
if they are in cargo.

### Proph



### Aug

### Drake

### Osprey

### Gnosis

### Blackbird

It is strongly recommended that you have IV cruiser, ECM, capacitor and targeting skills before flying this.

All up expect about a two week train to fly a Blackbird well from a very new account. Accounts with solid
core skills would be able to fly this in only a few days extra training.

Make sure you do not run the MWD when not absolutely required, it will drain your capacitor extremely fast.
