## Not In Kansas Any More

There are no stations in wormholes.  We live in POS's instead - essentially bubbles that only corp members can enter.  You can't dock, but you can store your mods and ships in certain kinds of anchored containers and refit ships in space like using a mobile depot.

## Overview

## Your Permissions

Open your pilot information window and check the titles assigned to you (they may not be in the same order as shown):

### Your Tower

As a corp member you can enter the public staging tower `Tengoo Fun Club` and one more private home tower (shown in your titles).  You should keep most of your assets in your home tower.  A director should invite you to that tower's password channel on Slack; the password will be in the MOTD.

| Code |      Tower Name      |
|:----:|:--------------------:|
|   A  |    Tengoo Fun Club   |
|   B  |  Brutor Spiderlings  |
|   C  |   Cuckdari Tengoos   |
|   D  | Deutche Stripperinen |

### Your Division

Some storage structures are split into 7 divisions.  Access to each division can be controlled via permissions.  Every corp member with permissions for a given division can store and take items from that division.

As a corp members you can use Division 1 and one more secure division (shown in your titles).

You will usually be sharing your more secure division with a few other pilots.  At the time of this writing, no more than two members have access to any given secure division.

## Storage Structure Specifics

PHA - Personal Hangar Array

: No one - not even directors - can see or touch what you put in here.  It is totally safe from theft.  *However*, if it is offlined, all items in it are deleted (like if the corp moves to a different hole or tower while you are inactive, or the POS is destroyed by enemies.)  If you are going to be inactive for a while, please PLEASE move your stuff out of here and into a ship with your tag on it or *something* so you don't lose it.

CHA - Corp Hangar Array

: Is divided into 7 divisions, each of which has much more space than the PHA (you can store a few packaged ships inside a division). Directors can use all divisions (so they can evacuate your stuff in an emergency - or steal it if they want to). Everyone has access to Div 1 as well as whatever their assigned Div is. You are only at risk of theft from people who share your division.

SMA - Ship Maintainence Array

: Can only store ships; has no divisions.  Everyone in the corp can store ships here, and everyone can eject any ship from here even if they aren't able to fly it (and bump it out of the bubble lololol).  Most of the "public" ships are kept here - hole rolling, salvaging, scanning, shuttles, etc.

LSAA - Large Ship Assembly Array

: Is divided into 7 divisions like the CHA, and the same permissions apply. Can store anything but to use a ship you need to drag it to the SMA first.  Provides a measure of security for ship storage; you should probably keep your personal/valuable ships here.

## First Rule of Eve (Wormhole Corollary)

Whatever you bring into a wormhole is already lost, so make sure you can afford it.
