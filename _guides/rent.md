## Introduction

Living in wormholes costs a good amount of ISK.  This guide explains how members contribute to the corp so that we have enough enough money to pay for fuel, mapping tool, and miscellaneous other corp expenses.

## Overview

## Basic Info

To live in a secure All-Out POS, you must pay rent.

Rent amount is calculated as **All-Out Operating Expenses** *divided by* **Number of Renters** and sent out as a corp mail around the first of each month.

Renters have until the end of the month to pay.

Assets belonging to renters who go inactive or miss payments will first be moved to the public staging POS, and later if we need the space they'll be moved out to high sec for retrieval at the owners' leisure.

## Operating Expenses

|           Expense            | Monthly Cost |
|:----------------------------:|:-----------:|
|    Tengoo Fun Club [fuel]     |     400m    |
|  Brutor Spiderlings [fuel]    |     200m    |
|   Cuckdari Tengoos [fuel]     |     200m    |
| Deutsche Stripperinnen [fuel] |     200m    |
|     Vippy [subscription]      |     300m    |
|      Top Scanner Prize        |      50m    |
|        Miscellaneous          |     200m    |

Total cost is 1.55b monthly; rent will likely be between 40m to 80m monthly.

Miscellaneous expenses include but are not limited to:

- [Subsidizing hole-rolling ships](http://all-out.github.io/guides/rolling/)
- [SRP for forward tackle](http://all-out.github.io/guides/prizes/)
- Subsidizing home-defense ships
- Subsidizing cheap roaming ships

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I'm Poor, How Can I Pay This?

We strongly recommend you join our [planetary interaction program](http://all-out.github.io/guides/planetary-interaction/) - at our usual activity levels, you should be able to pay your rent with about a quarter of one character's monthly PI money and it takes about a week to train. [Relic exploration](http://all-out.github.io/guides/exploration-relic-data/) is also an excellent way of making ISK (not to mention you'll find content for us in our chains on the side).  Ask in Slack for more ideas if neither of those float your boat.

### What If I Don't Want to Pay Rent?

You will still be able to:

- Be a member of All-Out
- See/use our wormhole chains
- Use our staging POS, meaning you can:
    - Enter the force field
    - Fit ships from the SMA
    - Store ships in the SMA (public)
    - Store items in the CHA (public)

You will *not* be able to:

- Use any of our secured POS, meaning you can't:
    - Enter the force field
    - Have access to any PHA
    - Have access to any LSAA

### I'm Rich, How Do I Help Out More?

You can **pledge** to pay an amount each month *in addition* to your regular rent, as mailed out each month.

Pledges will be used to offset the rent amount for everyone - by paying more, you are allowing other people who may not be able to make as much ISK as you to pay less.  The rent equation becomes (**All-Out Operating Expenses** *minus* **Total Pledges**) *divided by* **Number of Renters**.

**Example**: Rent would have been be 60m.  Joe pledges 100m.  The rent is now 56m.  Every non-pledger pays 56m, and Joe pays 156m.

Contact a director to let them know what amount you would like to pledge.
