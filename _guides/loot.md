## Overview

## Responsibility

After a PVP op, the fleet chooses *one* person to collect all the loot and then apportion it appropriately (using ISK or loot, at the splitter's choice).  If no one wants this headache, deliver the loot to a director in the **Nakkisuoja** citadel along with a mail with the info needed to do the split.

## Distribution

### First Priority: Reimbursement

The first loot priority is to offset losses incurred during the operation.  Distribute payment to pilots in proportion to the cost of their loss (after insurance).  No pilot should receive more than the cost of their loss after insurance.

Simple example:

>A fleet finishes.  **Alice lost 10m** and **Bob lost 30m** (both after insurance), for a total loss of 40m.  The fleet has **60m in loot**.  Total losses are less than total loot, so losses can be completely reimbursed.  **Alice receives 10m** and **Bob receives 30m**.  20m in loot is left over for other things.

Tricky example:

>A fleet finishes.  **Alice lost 10m** and **Bob lost 30m** (both after insurance), for a total loss of 40m.  The fleet has **20m in loot**.  Total losses are greater than total loot, so the losses cannot be completely reimbursed.  **Alice receives 5m** (10/40 loss = .25 factor = 5/20 payment) and **Bob receives 15m** (30/40 loss = .75 factor = 15/20 payment).  All the loot is used for reimbursement.

The loot splitter can contest that a loss is not eligible for reimbursment (full or partial) for the following reasons:

- The pilot performed an action against the recommendation of his FC and lost his ship
- The pilot performed a risky action without communicating with his fleet and lost his ship
- The ship was needlessly expensively fitted or out of doctrine (e.g., faction cruiser in a T1 destroyer roam, etc)
- The ship was carrying cargo more valuable than should have been risked by that combination of pilot, ship and fit

The above reasons are not rules, but rather guidelines that are in place to help prevent friction.  When people cannot agree on the validity of a reimbursment request, dissatisfied parties may appeal to a director, who will have the final say.

### Second Priority: Scout

If loot remains after reimbursements, 50% of the remaining loot value is given to the scout (i.e., the person who first made the corp or alliance aware of the content).  If multiple people scouted the content, they get equal shares of the scout's portion.

### Third Priority: Participation

Everyone who participated in the operation in some form or another (including the scouts) gets an equal share of remaining loot after reimbursments and scout portion have been payed out.
