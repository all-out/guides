    How to create content in Wormhole Space
---
## Scanning Is Your Friend

We are a small wormhole corp.  Content won't be given to us automatically like null F1 monkies - *we have to work for it.*

The primary way to create content in wormhole space is by scanning.  Scanning ten wormholes down instead of just scanning the static down increases our chance of content by ten times.

There are players in wormhole space and null who are making a lot of money running sites and are just waiting to be dunked - but we won't kill cucks if we don't search for them.

And we won't kill them by sitting in our POS.

And we won't kill them by not logging in and asking in slack "content when?".

With scouting and scanning we have gotten some excellent fights in wormhole space and null.  That's how we badoodled an Isogen 5 fleet, that's how I found the AFK Chimera, etc., etc.

*SO GET ON SCANNING YOU FUCKS. STOP WAITING FOR IT. CREATE YOUR OWN FUCKING CONTENT.*

Scan the 1. Then scan the 11, and the 12. And so forth. Null exits are great; null is full of ratters. If you find one, scout out the surrounding null systems.

*IF OUR STATIC IS COMPLETELY SCOUTED AND SHIT YOU CAN JUST ROLL IT.*

## Scouting a System

Check your system map to see if all planets are within dscan range. If some are not, warp around to make sure you get dscan coverage of every planet.

**Hot Nootkin Tip:**

WHEN YOU  JUMP INTO A SYSTEM, IMMEDIATELY DSCAN AT 14.3 AU AND SEE WHAT YOU FIND. PLEASE DO NOT DROP PROBES THE SECOND YOU ENTER SYSTEM, THAT'S THE EASIEST WAY TO SCARE OFF PREY.

### Ratters
If there's a common ratting boat on wide dscan, check anoms with narrow dscan.  If he's at one of them, he's a confirmed target.

### Towers
If there are less forcefields than towers on dscan, figure out if the offline towers have SMAs.  These are loot piñatas, and don't last long.

### Wrecks
If these are on wide dscan, there have been ratters in the area within the last two hours.

## What Ship to Use

Use a covops - **Anathema**, **Buzzard**, **Helios**, **Cheetah** and **Astero**. Training time for an Astero is less than a day, training for a covops cloak is about four days.

## You Found a Thing!

Ping `#subbed_eve` with `@channel`.

## In Closing -
*DO SOMETHING. DON'T SIT THERE AND WAIT.*

Even if you don't find any PvP content while scanning, you will at least get rewarded by PvE stuff like juicy relics.

If you are doing sites that have been scanned down by somebody else in the corp, it's nice to drop him a tip. Just check who created the bookmark.

If you are scanning always edit the sigs in vippy. Helps everybody a lot. Thanks. See [All-Out's Guide to Vippy.](http://all-out.github.io/guides/scanning-vippy/)
