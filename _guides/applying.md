## The Application

### General Questions

We have adopted a new application process, please answer the below questions carefully to demonstrate suitability for a role in our corporation:

#### Befuddled Bashing

Satori is at work on a Wednesday putting together an announcement for the upcoming bash, however digging through through communication logs he can't determine when the structure comes out of reinforcement.

He found a message from X on Tuesday who scouted the target, reporting "The final timer comes out in 3 days".
X lives in Australia and did not state the exact time or make it clear if it was in EVE time (+0) or local time +(10).

Y placed a seed in the hole then dropped off the face of the planet and has not been heard from since.
His last message stated the citadel came out of reinforce at 26:00 on the bash day, Y is American (-10), it is not clear why he was using Japanese time systems when he doesn't live in Japan.

From the garbled information Satori narrows down the following possibilties:

Friday 1200 EVE
Saturday 0200 EVE
Saturday 1200 EVE
Sunday 0200 EVE

What day and time does Satori announce the bash?



























This section can be waived at a [director](http://all-out.github.io/guides/people/#directors)'s discretion.  If one of them tells you that you don't need to answer these, please **say so in your application** and **include the director's name**.

- What have you been doing in Eve till now?
- What are you excited about doing in Eve?  What kind of goals do you have?
- How did you hear about All-Out?
- What have you heard about All-Out already?
- (If applicable) How do you feel about the corp you would be leaving? Why are you leaving them?
- (If applicable) Is there a current or past member of All-Out who can vouch for you or who recommended us to you?
- Are you USTZ, EUTZ, or AUTZ?  (Or are you a special snowflake of some kind?)
- Who is you are waifu?

Feel free to include any additional information that you think is relevant.

### Full API key

No longer required, we have nothing worth stealing now that we live out of Citadels rather than POS Towers

### Email Address

No longer required, Discord does not need a publically visable email address.


## General Application Tips

- Avoid one-word answers to the application questions (no need to write a novel, though).
- Join the in-game chat channel <button class="btn btn-primary btn-xs" type="button" title="Click button in in-game browser to join channel" onclick="CCPEVE.joinChannel('DoomedFromTheStart')">DoomedFromTheStart</button>.  Have it open while you're logged in and playing.  Say hello and that you're interested in checking out the corp.  Chill and chitchat with our members and friends.
- All Directors are lazy farts and applications take while to check, so displaying demonstrated interest is a plus.  Your app will probably get processed faster if you mention your impatience to a director in the pub channel from time to time.

## Why Hasn't My Application Been Accepted?

### Are there any recruitment restrictions in the `DoomedFromTheStart` MOTD?

Yes?  Depending on the situation, the corp might be on lockdown and acceptances are being delayed for security reasons.  Feel free to ask for clarification in the pub channel; if it's not >super opsec< we'll let you know what's up.  When the restrictions are lifted, your app will be processed normally (or we'll mail you with specifics).

No? Keep reading.

### Ask a director personally.

If you've included all the information we need and there are no current restrictions and you've talked to us but your application still hasn't been accepted, don't be afraid to mail a director and ask what's up.  Mostly likely we're just busy and haven't gotten around to it and a mail will remind us.  Or there might be some red flags on your app that we need more time to look at or ask you about.  It could be a lot of things; doesn't hurt at all to ask.
