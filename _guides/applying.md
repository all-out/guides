## The Application

### General Questions

We have adopted a new application process, please answer the below questions carefully to demonstrate suitability for a role in our corporation; include reasoning.

#### Befuddled Bashing

Satori is at work on a Wednesday putting together an announcement for the upcoming bash, however digging through through communication logs he can't determine when the structure comes out of reinforcement.

He found a message from X on Tuesday who scouted the target, reporting "The final timer comes out in 3 days".
X lives in Australia and did not state the exact time or make it clear if it was in EVE time (+0) or local time +(10).

Y placed a seed in the hole then dropped off the face of the planet and has not been heard from since.
His last message stated the citadel came out of reinforce at 26:00 on the bash day, Y is American (-10), it is not clear why he was using a niche Japanese time system.

From the garbled information Satori narrows down the following possibilties:

* Friday 1200 EVE
* Saturday 0200 EVE
* Saturday 1200 EVE
* Sunday 0200 EVE

What day and time should Satori announce the bash?

#### Risky Rolling
The bash time is fast approaching and Satori needs to start moving ships over. The current highsec exit is over 30 jumps away so he decides to roll for a better connection.

Z reported in discord that he was rolling the highsec, [Siggy](https://all-out.github.io/guides/siggy/) confirms he started rolling however the hisec is still up and only reduced.

See attached rolling guide members are instructed to follow: [Rolling Guide](https://all-out.github.io/guides/rolling-wormholes/) 

Satori is in a hurry to roll as quickly as possible and knows the folling information:

* A cold jump is 200M
* A hot jump is 300M
* Siggy has a 50/50 chance of recording a jump, in this case 500M is recorded
* This hole has between 1800M - 2200M mass with an even distribution
* Wormholes reduce at 50% of total mass
* Wormholes go critical at 10% of total mass
* All-Out members rarely read instructions

What is the likely risk he rolls himself out on a hot-hot pass?

* 0%
* 12.5%
* 25%
* 37.5%
* 50%
* 75%
* 100%


#### Ludicrous Looting
The bash was a great success! Despite demoralisation on comms and a third of the fleet showing up with the wrong type of tank.

Unfortunately for Satori most people fucked off after looting the expensive bits, leaving him to clean up the rest and distribute shares.

Assuming the following scheme is followed:

* 2 shares for finding the target
* 1 share for assisting with scouting and hole control
* 1 share per day participating in shooting structures
* 1 share for helping sort loot

Satori trawls through chat logs afterwards and finds the following information:

* Tom scouted the target
* Harry says he attended one day and doesn't remember seeing Tom
* Tom did not recall Harry helping with hole control
* Dick bashed both days
* Dick says he didn't see Tom helping hole control
* Harry also says Tom did not help with hole control
* Tom says he was on his seed alt the whole time and helped bash
* Harry says he helped loot after the second bash
* Dick says three people bashed each day
* Satori is a commie and through some obtuse logic has given up all of his shares so others can get a fair amount

What percent of loot should Tom recieve?


### Full API key

No longer required, we have nothing worth stealing now that we live out of Citadels rather than POS Towers

### Email Address

No longer required, Discord does not need a publically visable email address.


## Why Hasn't My Application Been Accepted?

### Are there any recruitment restrictions in the `DoomedFromTheStart` MOTD?

Yes?  Depending on the situation, the corp might be on lockdown and acceptances are being delayed for security reasons.  Feel free to ask for clarification in the pub channel; if it's not >super opsec< we'll let you know what's up.  When the restrictions are lifted, your app will be processed normally (or we'll mail you with specifics).

No? Keep reading.

### Ask a director personally.

If you've included sesible logic in your answers (even if they are wrong), mostly likely we're just busy and haven't gotten around to it and a mail will remind us.  Or there might be some red flags on your app that we need more time to look at or ask you about.  It could be a lot of things; doesn't hurt at all to ask.
